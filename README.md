## Features

### ðŸŒŸ User-Centric Features

- **Personalized Survey**: Users complete a short survey about their interests and preferences (e.g., indoor/outdoor activities, cooking, music, etc.).
- **Activity Recommendations**: Based on survey responses, users receive tailored suggestions for fun and creative activities.
- **Companionship Matching**: The app helps users find others with similar interests for shared activities.

### ðŸ§  Technology-Driven Features

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Using Google's Gemini AI, the app generates personalized and creative activity suggestions.
- **Secure User Management**: Built with FastAPI for secure registration, login, and data management.
- **Real-Time Engagement**: Users can explore new hobbies and connect with like-minded people in real-time.

## How It Works

1. **Register/Login**: Users sign up with their email and create a profile.
2. **Complete the Survey**: Users answer a few questions about their preferences (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor activities, hobbies, etc.).
3. **Get Recommendations**: Based on survey data, the app generates personalized activity suggestions using advanced AI.
4. **Connect and Act**: Users explore suggestions and find companions to join them in these activities.
